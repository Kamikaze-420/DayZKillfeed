# DayZ Console Killfeed by Kamikaze 🎮

Welcome to the open-source DayZ Console Killfeed project. We encourage you to contribute to the code and help us make the DayZ console experience better, one feed at a time.

## 🎯 Objective 

This project aims to counterbalance the proprietary nature of existing killfeeds by offering a community-driven, transparent alternative. Together, we can revolutionize how server owners and players interact with DayZ.

## 🛠️ Features 

Here's what the project currently offers:

- 📊 **Killfeed**

- 📝 **File Editing**
- 📡 **Radars**
- 📈 **Log Parsing for Killfeed**
